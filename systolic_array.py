"""
Systolic Array Implementation: C = A @ B using a weight-stationary systolic array

- Weights A[i, k] are preloaded into PE(i, k) and stay stationary.
- Activations B[k, j] stream North-to-South down column k.
- Partial sums stream West-to-East along row i.
- Final results C[i, j] emerge from the East edge of the PE array.

(This does not exactly match the example animation in the README!)
